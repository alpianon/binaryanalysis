To install BAT in Debian 8 or 9 you need to:

1. Enable non-free repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list (unrar package is needed)
2. Only for Debian 9: install [python-support](http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-support/python-support_1.0.15_all.deb) from Debian 8
3. Run `apt update` and then `apt install ./bat_37.0_all.deb`
